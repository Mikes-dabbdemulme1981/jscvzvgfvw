OMG, just watched It Feeds, and wow, what a ride! ðŸ˜‚ So I just gotta say, those jump scares are getting way too predictable, like, can I get a break, filmmakers? But I guess I was still kind of holding my breath, so touchÃ©, I guess? Anyway, I swear, this movie's got an ending that feels like it just slapped you in the face, like, who does that?! 

I donâ€™t know if it's just me or if that one demon looked like he wandered off a 1980s rock music video. Crack me up every time, lol. You literally need to download the movie and see what I mean. Trust me on this one! 

> It's kinda nuts how they keep trying to make every creepy kid in horror flicks like a mini Hannibal Lecter, babbling all cryptic and stuff. Little dude needs a chill pill. And that main character? Learn some self-preservation, girl. Seriously!

Speaking of crazy, weren't those special effects sometimes more hilarious than scary? Like, yeah, the CGI budget was clearly on a diet. And don't even get me started on the dialogue. Some of those lines, I was just sitting there like, did a robot write this or what? ðŸ˜‚

int ghostChase = new Random().Next(2, 7); // Was this in the movie tho? LOL, no idea.

Gonna need a hot cup of tea to calm my nerves, or maybe just to keep myself awake after that ending. Gotta watch the movie again with better lighting or something. Anyway, next time, popcorn's on you!
